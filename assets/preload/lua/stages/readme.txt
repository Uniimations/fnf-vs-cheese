Add your stage .json and .lua files here!

This only works for adding new songs that are not hardcoded into the source code.
If you add a song using the lua folder, make a .json for that song in this folder!
For example, if my song is "fresh" then the stage .json will be called "fresh.json"

For .lua files, specify the name of your stage lua file in your .json
